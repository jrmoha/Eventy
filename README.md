## Project Overview

## Eventy is a web-based social media platform that connects individuals through shared interests in local and global events. It modernizes event venue access with an e-ticketing system, providing a seamless platform for event discovery, engagement, and experience sharing.

## Motivation

Despite widespread digitization, the event industry still relies heavily on paper tickets. Eventy aims to bridge this gap by offering a digital solution for event creation, ticket purchasing, and validation. Our goal is to enhance user experience and promote sustainability by reducing paper usage.

- **Event Creation**: Organizers can create and manage events, displaying all relevant information.
- **E-Ticketing**: Users can purchase and validate e-tickets via QR codes.
- **Follow and Block Users**: Users can follow others to see their updates and block users as needed.
- **News Feed**: Aggregates posts from followed users, events, and ads, with filters for price, distance, and interests.
- **Send Reminders**: Users receive email reminders for upcoming events.
- **Ratings and Reviews**: Users can rate events, and organizers receive ratings based on their events.
- **Advertisements**: Organizers can create advertisements for events, with costs based on packages or impressions.
- **RSVP**: Users can respond to event invitations and receive reminders.
- **Chat and Community Creation**: Provides private chat and event-specific forums for attendees and organizers.
- **Book and Validate Tickets**: Users can buy e-tickets and organizers can validate them using QR codes.
